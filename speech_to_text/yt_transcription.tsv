3.639	6.56	president Donald
11.44	16.32	Trump KLA Harris have a good debate see
14.799	18.759999999999998	you have fun thank
16.32	20.0	you welcome to you both it's wonderful
18.76	21.92	to have you it's an honor to have you
20.0	23.72	both here tonight good evening we are
21.92	26.160000000000004	looking forward to a spirited and
23.72	27.519	thoughtful debate so let's get started I
26.16	29.279	want to begin tonight with the issue
27.519	31.24	that voters repeatedly say is their
29.279	33.48	number one issue and that is the economy
31.24	35.04	and the cost of living in this country
33.48	36.718999999999994	vice president Harris you and president
35.04	38.8	Trump were elected four years ago and
36.719	41.160000000000004	your opponent on the stage here tonight
38.8	43.48	often asks his supporters are you better
41.16	45.16	off than you were four years ago when it
43.48	46.64	comes to the economy do you believe
45.16	50.76	Americans are better off that they were
46.64	53.399	four years ago so I was raised as a
50.76	55.879	middle class kid and I am actually the
53.399	57.64	only person on this stage who has a plan
55.879	60.16	that is about lifting up the middle
57.64	63.039	class and working people of America I
60.16	65.439	believe in the Ambitions the aspirations
63.039	67.72	the dreams of the American people and
65.439	69.55999999999999	that is why I imagine and have actually
67.72	71.72	a plan to build what I call an
69.56	74.64	opportunity economy because here's the
71.72	77.08	thing we know that we have a a shortage
74.64	78.88	of of homes and housing and the cost of
77.08	81.64	housing is too expensive for far too
78.88	84.6	many people we know that young families
81.64	87.759	need support to raise their children and
84.6	90.24	I intend on extending a tax cut for
87.759	92.56	those families of $6,000 which is is the
90.24	94.96	largest child tax credit that we have
92.56	97.56	given in a long time so that those young
94.96	100.67999999999999	families can afford to buy a crib buy a
97.56	103.52	car seat buy clothes for their children
100.68	105.60000000000001	my passion one of them is small
103.52	107.84	businesses I was actually my mother
105.6	109.6	raised my sister and me but there was a
107.84	111.119	woman who helped raise us we call her
109.6	113.0	our second mother she was a small
111.119	115.88	business owner I love our small
113.0	119.159	businesses my plan is to give a
115.88	121.399	$50,000 tax deduction to Startup small
119.159	123.84	businesses knowing they are part of the
121.399	126.119	backbone of America's economy my
123.84	128.52	opponent on the other hand his plan is
126.119	131.039	to do what he has done before which is
128.52	133.72	to provide a tax cut for billionaires
131.039	136.72	and big corporations which will result
133.72	138.519	in5 trillion dollar to America's deficit
136.72	142.04	my opponent has a plan that I call the
138.519	145.36	Trump's sales tax which would be a 20%
142.04	148.2	tax on everyday Goods that you rely on
145.36	150.72000000000003	to get through the month economists have
148.2	152.599	said that that Trump say sales tax would
150.72	156.92	actually result for middle class
152.599	160.11999999999998	families in about $4,000 more a year
156.92	163.319	because of his policies and his ideas
160.12	166.08	about what should be the backs of middle
163.319	167.879	class people paying for tax cuts for
166.08	169.92000000000002	billionaires president Trump I'll give
167.879	171.879	you two minutes first of all I have no
169.92	174.39999999999998	sales tax that's an incorrect statement
171.879	175.79999999999998	she knows that we're doing tariffs on
174.4	179.04	other countries other countries are
175.8	180.64000000000001	going to finally after 75 years pay us
179.04	184.04	back for all the we've done for the
180.64	185.92	world and the Tariff will be substantial
184.04	187.519	in some cases I took in billions and
185.92	189.79899999999998	billions of dollars as you know from
187.519	191.36	China in fact they never took the Tariff
189.799	193.44	off because it was so much money they
191.36	195.239	can't it would totally destroy
193.44	196.799	everything that they've set out to do
195.239	198.56	they're taking in billions of dollars
196.799	200.76000000000002	from China and other places they've left
198.56	203.28	the tariffs on when I had it I had
200.76	205.959	tariffs and yet I had no inflation uh
203.28	207.84	look we've had a terrible economy
205.959	209.84	because inflation has which is really
207.84	212.239	known as a country Buster it breaks up
209.84	214.439	countries we have inflation like very
212.239	216.159	few people have ever seen before
214.439	219.35999999999999	probably the worst in our nation's
216.159	221.56	history we were at 21% but that's being
219.36	224.15900000000002	generous because many things are 50 60
221.56	226.799	70 and 80% higher than they were just a
224.159	228.519	few years ago this has been a disaster
226.799	231.12	for people for the middle class but for
228.519	232.87900000000002	every class on top of that we have
231.12	235.36	millions of people pouring into our
232.879	238.39999999999998	country from prisons and jails from
235.36	240.84	mental institutions and insane asylums
238.4	242.959	and they're coming in and they're taking
240.84	246.04	jobs that are occupied right now by
242.959	247.76	African-Americans and Hispanics and also
246.04	249.72	unions unions are going to be affected
247.76	251.2	very soon and you see what's happening
249.72	253.239	you see what's happening with towns
251.2	256.479	throughout the United States you look at
253.239	259.04	Springfield Ohio you look at Aurora in
256.479	260.59999999999997	Colorado they are taking over the towns
259.04	263.52000000000004	they're taking over buildings they're
260.6	267.12	going in violently these are the people
263.52	268.96	that she and Biden led into our country
267.12	271.12	and they're destroying our country
268.96	273.56	they're dangering they're at the highest
271.12	275.68	level of criminality and we have to get
273.56	277.919	them out we have to get them out fast I
275.68	280.28000000000003	created one of the greatest economies in
277.919	282.039	the history of our country I'll do it
280.28	283.79999999999995	again and even better we are going to
282.039	285.8	get to immigration and border security
283.8	287.6	during this debate but uh I would like
285.8	290.08	to let vice president Harris respond on
287.6	293.0	the economy here well I would love to
290.08	296.639	let's talk about what Donald Trump left
293.0	299.72	us Donald Trump left us the worst
296.639	302.6	unemployment since the Great Depression
299.72	306.16	Donald Trump left us the worst Public
302.6	310.03900000000004	Health epidemic in a century Donald
306.16	314.0	Trump left us the worst attack on our
310.039	316.36	democracy since the Civil War and what
314.0	319.199	we have done is clean up Donald Trump's
316.36	321.759	mess what we have done and what I intend
319.199	323.12	to do is build on what we know are the
321.759	324.36	aspirations and the hopes of the
323.12	326.28000000000003	American people but I'm going to tell
324.36	328.52000000000004	youall in this debate tonight you're
326.28	332.19899999999996	going to hear from the same old tired
328.52	334.479	Playbook a bunch of Lies Grievances and
332.199	337.759	name calling what you're going to hear
334.479	340.52	tonight is a detailed and dangerous Plan
337.759	342.47900000000004	called project 2025 that the former
340.52	346.08	president intends on implementing if he
342.479	348.919	were elected to again I believe very
346.08	351.31899999999996	strongly that the American people want a
348.919	353.28	president who understands the importance
351.319	355.16	of bringing us together KN we have so
353.28	357.67999999999995	much more in common than what separates
355.16	359.44	us and I pledge to you to be a president
357.68	360.96	for all Americans president Trump will
359.44	362.68	give you a minute here to respond number
360.96	364.19899999999996	one I have nothing to do as you know and
362.68	367.199	as she knows better than anyone I have
364.199	369.24	nothing to do with project 2025 uh
367.199	370.91900000000004	that's out there I haven't read it I
369.24	372.599	don't want to read it purposely I'm not
370.919	374.12	going to read it this was a group of
372.599	376.0	people that got together they came up
374.12	378.16	with some ideas I guess some good some
376.0	379.84	bad but it makes no difference I have
378.16	381.47900000000004	nothing to do everybody knows I'm an
379.84	383.919	open book everybody knows what I'm going
381.479	386.599	to do cut taxes very substantially and
383.919	388.52	create a great economy like I did before
386.599	391.52	we had the greatest economy we got hit
388.52	394.84	with a pandemic and the pandemic was not
391.52	396.52	since 1917 where 100 million people died
394.84	398.919	has there been anything like it we did a
396.52	401.84	phenomenal job with the pandemic we
398.919	403.75899999999996	handed them over a country where the
401.84	406.0	economy and where the stock market was
403.759	408.36	higher than it was before the pandemic
406.0	410.8	came in nobody's ever seen anything like
408.36	413.40000000000003	it we made ventilators for the entire
410.8	415.56	world we got gowns we got masks we did
413.4	417.28	things that nobody thought possible and
415.56	418.96	people give me credit for rebuilding the
417.28	421.08	military they give me credit for a lot
418.96	423.08	of things but not enough credit for the
421.08	424.919	great job we did with the pandemic but
423.08	427.56	the only jobs they got were bounceback
424.919	429.039	jobs these were jobs bounceback and it
427.56	431.319	bounced back and it went to their
429.039	433.08	benefit but I was the one that created
431.319	434.72	them they know it and so does everybody
433.08	436.24	else vice president Harris I'll let you
434.72	440.199	respond
436.24	442.40000000000003	so Donald Trump has no plan for you and
440.199	444.36	when you look at his economic plan it's
442.4	447.63899999999995	all about tax breaks for the richest
444.36	450.44	people I am offering what I describe as
447.639	452.40000000000003	an opportunity economy and and the best
450.44	455.36	economists in our country if not the
452.4	458.23999999999995	world have reviewed our relative plans
455.36	460.759	for the future of America what Goldman
458.24	463.40000000000003	Sachs has said is that Donald Trump's
460.759	465.68	plan would make the economy worse mine
463.4	467.4	would strengthen the economy what the
465.68	470.96	Wharton School has said is Donald
467.4	475.0	Trump's plan would actually explode the
470.96	477.039	deficit 16 Nobel laurates have described
475.0	479.039	his economic plan as something that
477.039	481.71999999999997	would increase inflation and by the
479.039	484.84	middle of next year would invite a
481.72	486.68	recession you just have to look at where
484.84	489.0	we are and where we stand on the issues
486.68	491.72	and I'd invite you to know that Donald
489.0	493.199	Trump actually has no plan for you
491.72	495.40000000000003	because he is more interested in
493.199	498.56	defending himself than he is in looking
495.4	500.79999999999995	out for you it's just a sound her that
498.56	503.039	to say look I went to the Wharton School
500.8	505.40000000000003	of finance and many of those professors
503.039	507.199	the top professors think my plan is a
505.4	509.159	brilliant plan it's a great plan it's a
507.199	511.199	plan that's going to bring up our our
509.159	513.479	work our value as a country it's going
511.199	515.9590000000001	to make people want to be able to go and
513.479	519.399	work and uh create jobs and create a lot
515.959	522.4399999999999	of good solid money for our for our
519.399	525.2	country and just to finish off uh she
522.44	528.839	doesn't have a plan she copied Biden's
525.2	532.0	plan and it's like four sentences like
528.839	534.7600000000001	Run Spot Run four sentences that are
532.0	536.12	just oh we'll try and lower taxes she
534.76	538.519	doesn't have a plan take a look at her
536.12	540.68	plan she doesn't have a plan Mr
538.519	540.68	President
