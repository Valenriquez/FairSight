1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Now, welcome the candidates to the stage.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,800
Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
Kamala Harris, is that a good debate?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,360
Yes, you see. Have fun.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,280
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,200
Welcome to you both.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,160
It's wonderful to have you.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,800
It's an honor to have you both here tonight.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,520
Good evening.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,840
We are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,080
So let's get started.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,520
I want to begin tonight with the issue

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,800
that voters repeatedly say is their number one

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,520
in this country.

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
Vice President Harris, you and President Trump

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,280
were elected four years ago, and your opponent

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,520
on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters,

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,280
are you better off than you were four years ago?

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,680
When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,160
are better off than they were four years ago?

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,240
So I was raised as a middle-class kid,

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,040
and I am actually the only person on this stage

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,920
who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,920
and working people of America.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,080
I believe in the ambition, the aspirations,

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,240
the dreams of the American people.

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,320
And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,120
to build what I call an opportunity economy.

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,440
Because here's the thing.

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,480
We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing,

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,720
and the cost of housing is too expensive for our

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,960
too many people.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,480
We know that young families need support

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,440
to raise their children, and I intend on extending

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,720
a tax cut for those families of $6,000,

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,200
which is the largest child tax credit

38
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,960
that we have given in a long time,

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,320
so that those young families can afford to buy a crib,

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,560
buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children.

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,200
My passion, one of them, is small businesses.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,240
I was actually, my mother raised my sister and me,

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,080
but there was a woman who helped raise us.

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,520
We call her our second mother.

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840
She was a small business owner.

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,920
I love our small businesses.

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,080
My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
to start-up small businesses,

49
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,640
knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,200
My opponent, on the other hand,

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
his plan is to do what he has done before,

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,000
which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,720
and big corporations, which will result

54
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,640
in $5 trillion to America's deficit.

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,200
My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump's sales tax,

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,120
which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,320
that you rely on to get through the month.

58
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Economists have said that that Trump sales tax

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,320
would actually result for middle-class families

60
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,760
in about $4,000 more a year,

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,000
because of his policies and his ideas

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,960
about what should be the backs of middle-class people

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,080
paying for tax cuts for billionaires.

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,840
President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.

65
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,720
First of all, I have no sales tax.

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
That's an incorrect statement.

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,080
She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries.

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,560
Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years,

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,520
pay us back for all that we've done for the world,

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,880
and the tariff will be substantial in some cases.

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
I took in billions and billions of dollars,

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,360
as you know, from China.

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
In fact, they never took the tariff off

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,040
because it was so much money they can't.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,880
They would totally destroy everything

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
that they've set out to do.

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,360
They're taking in billions of dollars from China

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,720
and other places they've left the tariffs on.

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,240
When I had it, I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation.

80
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,880
Look, we've had a terrible economy

81
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,120
because inflation has, which is really known

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,640
as a country buster, it breaks up countries.

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,400
We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before,

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,080
probably the worst in our nation's history.

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,800
We were at 21 percent, but that's being generous

86
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,440
because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80 percent higher

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,400
than they were just a few years ago.

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
This has been a disaster for people,

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
for the middle class, but for every class.

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,120
On top of that, we have millions of people

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,200
pouring into our country from prisons and jails,

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,440
from mental institutions and insane asylums,

93
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,240
and they're coming in and they're taking jobs

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,000
that are occupied right now by African Americans

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,520
and Hispanics and also unions.

96
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
Unions are going to be affected very soon,

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,720
and you see what's happening.

98
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
You see what's happening with towns

99
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,520
throughout the United States.

100
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,720
You look at Springfield, Ohio.

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,520
You look at Aurora in Colorado.

102
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
They are taking over the towns.

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
They're taking over buildings.

104
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
They're going in violently.

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,160
These are the people that she and Biden led into our country,

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
and they're destroying our country.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
They're dangerous.

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
They're at the highest level of criminality,

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
and we have to get them out.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,480
We have to get them out fast.

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,840
I created one of the greatest economies

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,800
in the history of our country.

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,640
I'll do it again and even better.

114
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,840
We are going to get to immigration and border security

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
during this debate, but I would like

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
Well, I would love to.

118
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us.

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
since the Great Depression.

121
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,400
Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,720
in a century.

123
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,480
since the Civil War.

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,320
And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,680
What we have done and what I intend to do

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,440
is build on what we know are the aspirations

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,800
and the hopes of the American people.

129
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,160
But I'm going to tell you all on this debate tonight,

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,880
you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook,

131
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,440
a bunch of lies, grievances, and name calling.

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,800
and dangerous plan called Project 2025

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,200
that the former president intends on implementing

135
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
if he were elected again.

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,520
I believe very strongly that the American people want

137
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,320
a president who understands the importance

138
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,560
of bringing us together.

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,760
No, we have so much more in common than what separates us.

140
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,880
And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.

141
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,720
President Trump will give you a minute here to respond.

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,960
Number one, I have nothing to do.

143
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,920
As you know, and as she knows better than anyone,

144
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,160
I have nothing to do with Project 2025.

145
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
That's out there. I haven't read it.

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
I don't want to read it purposely.

147
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm not going to read it.

148
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,520
This was a group of people that got together.

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,960
They came up with some ideas.

150
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,680
I guess some good, some bad.

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do.

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,360
Everybody knows I'm an open book.

153
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,760
Everybody knows what I'm going to do.

154
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Cut taxes very substantially

155
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,600
and create a great economy like I did before.

156
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,680
We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic.

157
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,960
And the pandemic was not since 1917,

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,840
where 100 million people died.

159
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,000
Has there been anything like it?

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,680
We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic.

161
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,400
We handed them over a country

162
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,560
where the economy and where the stock market

163
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,840
was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.

165
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
We made ventilators for the entire world.

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,080
We got gowns. We got masks.

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,440
We did things that nobody thought possible.

168
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,800
And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.

169
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,880
They give me credit for a lot of things,

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,840
but not enough credit for the great job we did

171
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
with the pandemic.

172
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,280
But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs.

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,200
These were jobs bounce-back.

174
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,840
And it bounced back and it went to their benefit.

175
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,560
But I was the one that created them.

176
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,440
They know it, and so does everybody else.

177
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.

178
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,840
So Donald Trump has no plan for you.

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,200
And when you look at his economic plan,

180
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
it's all about tax breaks for the richest people.

181
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,440
I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy.

182
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,800
And the best economists in our country,

183
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
if not the world,

184
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America.

185
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
What Goldman Sachs has said

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,120
is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse.

187
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Mine would strengthen the economy.

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,960
What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan

189
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,920
would actually explode the deficit.

190
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan

191
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,680
as something that would increase inflation

192
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,760
and by the middle of next year would invite a recession.

193
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,320
You just have to look at where we are

194
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
and where we stand on the issues.

195
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
And I'd invite you to know

196
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you

197
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
because he is more interested in defending himself

198
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
than he is in looking out for you.

199
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,800
That's just a sound bite.

200
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
They gave her that to say.

201
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,520
Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance

202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,320
and many of those professors, the top professors,

203
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
think my plan is a brilliant plan.

204
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
It's a great plan.

205
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth,

206
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,960
our value as a country.

207
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,800
It's going to make people want to be able to go and work

208
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,200
and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money

209
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
for our country.

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,840
And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan.

211
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,560
She copied Biden's plan and it's like four sentences,

212
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,400
like run, spot, run, four sentences that are just,

213
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,560
oh, we'll try and lower taxes.

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,480
She doesn't have a plan.

215
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,400
Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.

216
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,240
Mr. President.
