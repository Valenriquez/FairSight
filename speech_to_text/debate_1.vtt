WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
Now, welcome the candidates to the stage.

00:01.760 --> 00:04.800
Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.320
Kamala Harris, is that a good debate?

00:14.320 --> 00:15.360
Yes, you see. Have fun.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.280
Thank you.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.200
Welcome to you both.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.160
It's wonderful to have you.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.800
It's an honor to have you both here tonight.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.520
Good evening.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.840
We are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.080
So let's get started.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.520
I want to begin tonight with the issue

00:27.520 --> 00:29.800
that voters repeatedly say is their number one

00:30.160 --> 00:32.320
issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living

00:32.320 --> 00:33.520
in this country.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.360
Vice President Harris, you and President Trump

00:35.360 --> 00:37.280
were elected four years ago, and your opponent

00:37.280 --> 00:40.520
on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters,

00:40.520 --> 00:43.280
are you better off than you were four years ago?

00:43.280 --> 00:45.680
When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans

00:45.680 --> 00:48.160
are better off than they were four years ago?

00:48.160 --> 00:52.240
So I was raised as a middle-class kid,

00:52.240 --> 00:55.040
and I am actually the only person on this stage

00:55.040 --> 00:57.920
who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class

00:57.920 --> 00:59.920
and working people of America.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.080
I believe in the ambition, the aspirations,

01:03.080 --> 01:05.240
the dreams of the American people.

01:05.240 --> 01:08.320
And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan

01:08.320 --> 01:11.120
to build what I call an opportunity economy.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.440
Because here's the thing.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.480
We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing,

01:16.480 --> 01:18.720
and the cost of housing is too expensive for our

01:18.720 --> 01:19.960
too many people.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.480
We know that young families need support

01:23.200 --> 01:26.440
to raise their children, and I intend on extending

01:26.440 --> 01:29.720
a tax cut for those families of $6,000,

01:29.720 --> 01:32.200
which is the largest child tax credit

01:32.200 --> 01:33.960
that we have given in a long time,

01:33.960 --> 01:37.320
so that those young families can afford to buy a crib,

01:37.320 --> 01:40.560
buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.200
My passion, one of them, is small businesses.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.240
I was actually, my mother raised my sister and me,

01:47.240 --> 01:49.080
but there was a woman who helped raise us.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.520
We call her our second mother.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.840
She was a small business owner.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.920
I love our small businesses.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.080
My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction

01:58.080 --> 02:00.080
to start-up small businesses,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.640
knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.200
My opponent, on the other hand,

02:05.200 --> 02:08.200
his plan is to do what he has done before,

02:08.200 --> 02:11.000
which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires

02:11.000 --> 02:13.720
and big corporations, which will result

02:13.720 --> 02:16.640
in $5 trillion to America's deficit.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.200
My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump's sales tax,

02:20.200 --> 02:24.120
which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods

02:24.120 --> 02:27.320
that you rely on to get through the month.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.440
Economists have said that that Trump sales tax

02:30.440 --> 02:33.320
would actually result for middle-class families

02:33.320 --> 02:36.760
in about $4,000 more a year,

02:36.760 --> 02:40.000
because of his policies and his ideas

02:40.000 --> 02:43.960
about what should be the backs of middle-class people

02:43.960 --> 02:47.080
paying for tax cuts for billionaires.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.840
President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.720
First of all, I have no sales tax.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.920
That's an incorrect statement.

02:51.920 --> 02:55.080
She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.560
Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years,

02:58.560 --> 03:01.520
pay us back for all that we've done for the world,

03:01.520 --> 03:04.880
and the tariff will be substantial in some cases.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.880
I took in billions and billions of dollars,

03:06.880 --> 03:08.360
as you know, from China.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.000
In fact, they never took the tariff off

03:10.000 --> 03:12.040
because it was so much money they can't.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.880
They would totally destroy everything

03:13.880 --> 03:15.320
that they've set out to do.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.360
They're taking in billions of dollars from China

03:17.360 --> 03:19.720
and other places they've left the tariffs on.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.240
When I had it, I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.880
Look, we've had a terrible economy

03:25.880 --> 03:28.120
because inflation has, which is really known

03:28.120 --> 03:30.640
as a country buster, it breaks up countries.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.400
We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before,

03:34.400 --> 03:37.080
probably the worst in our nation's history.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.800
We were at 21 percent, but that's being generous

03:39.800 --> 03:43.440
because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80 percent higher

03:43.440 --> 03:45.400
than they were just a few years ago.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
This has been a disaster for people,

03:47.400 --> 03:49.440
for the middle class, but for every class.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.120
On top of that, we have millions of people

03:52.120 --> 03:55.200
pouring into our country from prisons and jails,

03:55.200 --> 03:58.440
from mental institutions and insane asylums,

03:58.440 --> 04:01.240
and they're coming in and they're taking jobs

04:01.240 --> 04:04.000
that are occupied right now by African Americans

04:04.000 --> 04:06.520
and Hispanics and also unions.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.680
Unions are going to be affected very soon,

04:08.680 --> 04:09.720
and you see what's happening.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.240
You see what's happening with towns

04:11.240 --> 04:12.520
throughout the United States.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.720
You look at Springfield, Ohio.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.520
You look at Aurora in Colorado.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.120
They are taking over the towns.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.480
They're taking over buildings.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.160
They're going in violently.

04:22.160 --> 04:27.160
These are the people that she and Biden led into our country,

04:27.160 --> 04:29.000
and they're destroying our country.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.240
They're dangerous.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.880
They're at the highest level of criminality,

04:32.880 --> 04:34.000
and we have to get them out.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.480
We have to get them out fast.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.840
I created one of the greatest economies

04:37.840 --> 04:39.800
in the history of our country.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.640
I'll do it again and even better.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.840
We are going to get to immigration and border security

04:43.840 --> 04:45.840
during this debate, but I would like

04:45.840 --> 04:48.720
to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.920
Well, I would love to.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.000
Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.520
Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment

04:57.520 --> 04:59.560
since the Great Depression.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.400
Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic

05:04.400 --> 05:05.720
in a century.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.960
Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy

05:10.960 --> 05:13.480
since the Civil War.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.320
And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.680
What we have done and what I intend to do

05:19.680 --> 05:22.440
is build on what we know are the aspirations

05:22.440 --> 05:23.800
and the hopes of the American people.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.160
But I'm going to tell you all on this debate tonight,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.880
you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook,

05:29.880 --> 05:33.440
a bunch of lies, grievances, and name calling.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.720
What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed

05:36.720 --> 05:39.800
and dangerous plan called Project 2025

05:39.800 --> 05:42.200
that the former president intends on implementing

05:42.200 --> 05:44.720
if he were elected again.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.520
I believe very strongly that the American people want

05:48.520 --> 05:51.320
a president who understands the importance

05:51.320 --> 05:52.560
of bringing us together.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.760
No, we have so much more in common than what separates us.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.880
And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.720
President Trump will give you a minute here to respond.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.960
Number one, I have nothing to do.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.920
As you know, and as she knows better than anyone,

06:03.920 --> 06:07.160
I have nothing to do with Project 2025.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.160
That's out there. I haven't read it.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.640
I don't want to read it purposely.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.840
I'm not going to read it.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.520
This was a group of people that got together.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.960
They came up with some ideas.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.680
I guess some good, some bad.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.880
But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.360
Everybody knows I'm an open book.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.760
Everybody knows what I'm going to do.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.760
Cut taxes very substantially

06:23.760 --> 06:26.600
and create a great economy like I did before.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.680
We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.960
And the pandemic was not since 1917,

06:32.960 --> 06:34.840
where 100 million people died.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.000
Has there been anything like it?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.680
We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.400
We handed them over a country

06:41.400 --> 06:43.560
where the economy and where the stock market

06:43.560 --> 06:46.840
was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.880
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.280
We made ventilators for the entire world.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.080
We got gowns. We got masks.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.440
We did things that nobody thought possible.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.800
And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.880
They give me credit for a lot of things,

06:59.880 --> 07:01.840
but not enough credit for the great job we did

07:01.840 --> 07:02.920
with the pandemic.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.280
But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.200
These were jobs bounce-back.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.840
And it bounced back and it went to their benefit.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.560
But I was the one that created them.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.440
They know it, and so does everybody else.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.560
Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.840
So Donald Trump has no plan for you.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.200
And when you look at his economic plan,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.200
it's all about tax breaks for the richest people.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.440
I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.800
And the best economists in our country,

07:31.800 --> 07:33.120
if not the world,

07:33.120 --> 07:37.520
have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.600
What Goldman Sachs has said

07:39.600 --> 07:43.120
is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.120
Mine would strengthen the economy.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.960
What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan

07:48.960 --> 07:51.920
would actually explode the deficit.

07:51.920 --> 07:56.200
Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan

07:56.200 --> 07:58.680
as something that would increase inflation

07:58.680 --> 08:02.760
and by the middle of next year would invite a recession.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.320
You just have to look at where we are

08:05.320 --> 08:06.720
and where we stand on the issues.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.400
And I'd invite you to know

08:08.400 --> 08:11.680
that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you

08:11.680 --> 08:14.560
because he is more interested in defending himself

08:14.560 --> 08:16.720
than he is in looking out for you.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.800
That's just a sound bite.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.200
They gave her that to say.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.520
Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance

08:21.520 --> 08:24.320
and many of those professors, the top professors,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.120
think my plan is a brilliant plan.

08:26.120 --> 08:26.960
It's a great plan.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.680
It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth,

08:29.680 --> 08:30.960
our value as a country.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.800
It's going to make people want to be able to go and work

08:33.800 --> 08:38.200
and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money

08:38.200 --> 08:40.000
for our country.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.840
And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.560
She copied Biden's plan and it's like four sentences,

08:48.560 --> 08:52.400
like run, spot, run, four sentences that are just,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.560
oh, we'll try and lower taxes.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.480
She doesn't have a plan.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.400
Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.240
Mr. President.
