0	1760	Now, welcome the candidates to the stage.
1760	4800	Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald Trump.
12400	14320	Kamala Harris, is that a good debate?
14320	15360	Yes, you see. Have fun.
15360	17280	Thank you.
17280	18200	Welcome to you both.
18200	19160	It's wonderful to have you.
19160	20800	It's an honor to have you both here tonight.
20800	21520	Good evening.
21520	24840	We are looking forward to a spirited and thoughtful debate.
24840	26080	So let's get started.
26080	27520	I want to begin tonight with the issue
27520	29800	that voters repeatedly say is their number one
30160	32320	issue, and that is the economy and the cost of living
32320	33520	in this country.
33520	35360	Vice President Harris, you and President Trump
35360	37280	were elected four years ago, and your opponent
37280	40520	on the stage here tonight often asks his supporters,
40520	43280	are you better off than you were four years ago?
43280	45680	When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans
45680	48160	are better off than they were four years ago?
48160	52240	So I was raised as a middle-class kid,
52240	55040	and I am actually the only person on this stage
55040	57920	who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class
57920	59920	and working people of America.
59920	63080	I believe in the ambition, the aspirations,
63080	65240	the dreams of the American people.
65240	68320	And that is why I imagine and have actually a plan
68320	71120	to build what I call an opportunity economy.
71120	72440	Because here's the thing.
72440	76480	We know that we have a shortage of homes and housing,
76480	78720	and the cost of housing is too expensive for our
78720	79960	too many people.
79960	82480	We know that young families need support
83200	86440	to raise their children, and I intend on extending
86440	89720	a tax cut for those families of $6,000,
89720	92200	which is the largest child tax credit
92200	93960	that we have given in a long time,
93960	97320	so that those young families can afford to buy a crib,
97320	100560	buy a car seat, buy clothes for their children.
100560	104200	My passion, one of them, is small businesses.
104200	107240	I was actually, my mother raised my sister and me,
107240	109080	but there was a woman who helped raise us.
109080	110520	We call her our second mother.
110520	111840	She was a small business owner.
111840	113920	I love our small businesses.
113920	118080	My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction
118080	120080	to start-up small businesses,
120080	123640	knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy.
123640	125200	My opponent, on the other hand,
125200	128200	his plan is to do what he has done before,
128200	131000	which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires
131000	133720	and big corporations, which will result
133720	136640	in $5 trillion to America's deficit.
136640	140200	My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump's sales tax,
140200	144120	which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods
144120	147320	that you rely on to get through the month.
147320	150440	Economists have said that that Trump sales tax
150440	153320	would actually result for middle-class families
153320	156760	in about $4,000 more a year,
156760	160000	because of his policies and his ideas
160000	163960	about what should be the backs of middle-class people
163960	167080	paying for tax cuts for billionaires.
167080	168840	President Trump, I'll give you two minutes.
168880	170720	First of all, I have no sales tax.
170720	171920	That's an incorrect statement.
171920	175080	She knows that we're doing tariffs on other countries.
175080	178560	Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years,
178560	181520	pay us back for all that we've done for the world,
181520	184880	and the tariff will be substantial in some cases.
184880	186880	I took in billions and billions of dollars,
186880	188360	as you know, from China.
188360	190000	In fact, they never took the tariff off
190000	192040	because it was so much money they can't.
192040	193880	They would totally destroy everything
193880	195320	that they've set out to do.
195320	197360	They're taking in billions of dollars from China
197360	199720	and other places they've left the tariffs on.
199720	203240	When I had it, I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation.
203240	205880	Look, we've had a terrible economy
205880	208120	because inflation has, which is really known
208120	210640	as a country buster, it breaks up countries.
210640	214400	We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before,
214400	217080	probably the worst in our nation's history.
217080	219800	We were at 21 percent, but that's being generous
219800	223440	because many things are 50, 60, 70, and 80 percent higher
223440	225400	than they were just a few years ago.
225400	227400	This has been a disaster for people,
227400	229440	for the middle class, but for every class.
229440	232120	On top of that, we have millions of people
232120	235200	pouring into our country from prisons and jails,
235200	238440	from mental institutions and insane asylums,
238440	241240	and they're coming in and they're taking jobs
241240	244000	that are occupied right now by African Americans
244000	246520	and Hispanics and also unions.
246520	248680	Unions are going to be affected very soon,
248680	249720	and you see what's happening.
249720	251240	You see what's happening with towns
251240	252520	throughout the United States.
252520	254720	You look at Springfield, Ohio.
254720	257520	You look at Aurora in Colorado.
257520	259120	They are taking over the towns.
259120	260480	They're taking over buildings.
260480	262160	They're going in violently.
262160	267160	These are the people that she and Biden led into our country,
267160	269000	and they're destroying our country.
269000	270240	They're dangerous.
270240	272880	They're at the highest level of criminality,
272880	274000	and we have to get them out.
274000	275480	We have to get them out fast.
275480	277840	I created one of the greatest economies
277840	279800	in the history of our country.
279800	281640	I'll do it again and even better.
281640	283840	We are going to get to immigration and border security
283840	285840	during this debate, but I would like
285840	288720	to let Vice President Harris respond on the economy here.
288720	289920	Well, I would love to.
289920	294000	Let's talk about what Donald Trump left us.
294000	297520	Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment
297520	299560	since the Great Depression.
299560	304400	Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic
304400	305720	in a century.
305720	310960	Donald Trump left us the worst attack on our democracy
310960	313480	since the Civil War.
313520	317320	And what we have done is clean up Donald Trump's mess.
317320	319680	What we have done and what I intend to do
319680	322440	is build on what we know are the aspirations
322440	323800	and the hopes of the American people.
323800	326160	But I'm going to tell you all on this debate tonight,
326160	329880	you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook,
329880	333440	a bunch of lies, grievances, and name calling.
333440	336720	What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed
336720	339800	and dangerous plan called Project 2025
339800	342200	that the former president intends on implementing
342200	344720	if he were elected again.
344720	348520	I believe very strongly that the American people want
348520	351320	a president who understands the importance
351320	352560	of bringing us together.
352560	355760	No, we have so much more in common than what separates us.
355760	358880	And I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans.
358880	360720	President Trump will give you a minute here to respond.
360720	361960	Number one, I have nothing to do.
361960	363920	As you know, and as she knows better than anyone,
363920	367160	I have nothing to do with Project 2025.
367160	369160	That's out there. I haven't read it.
369160	370640	I don't want to read it purposely.
370640	371840	I'm not going to read it.
371840	373520	This was a group of people that got together.
373520	374960	They came up with some ideas.
374960	376680	I guess some good, some bad.
376680	378880	But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do.
378880	380360	Everybody knows I'm an open book.
380360	381760	Everybody knows what I'm going to do.
381760	383760	Cut taxes very substantially
383760	386600	and create a great economy like I did before.
386600	389680	We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic.
389680	392960	And the pandemic was not since 1917,
392960	394840	where 100 million people died.
394840	396000	Has there been anything like it?
396000	398680	We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic.
398680	401400	We handed them over a country
401400	403560	where the economy and where the stock market
403560	406840	was higher than it was before the pandemic came in.
406840	408880	Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
408880	411280	We made ventilators for the entire world.
411280	413080	We got gowns. We got masks.
413080	415440	We did things that nobody thought possible.
415440	417800	And people give me credit for rebuilding the military.
417800	419880	They give me credit for a lot of things,
419880	421840	but not enough credit for the great job we did
421840	422920	with the pandemic.
422920	425280	But the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs.
425280	427200	These were jobs bounce-back.
427200	429840	And it bounced back and it went to their benefit.
429840	431560	But I was the one that created them.
431560	433440	They know it, and so does everybody else.
433440	435560	Vice President Harris, I'll let you respond.
435560	439840	So Donald Trump has no plan for you.
439840	442200	And when you look at his economic plan,
442200	445200	it's all about tax breaks for the richest people.
445200	449440	I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy.
449440	451800	And the best economists in our country,
451800	453120	if not the world,
453120	457520	have reviewed our relative plans for the future of America.
457520	459600	What Goldman Sachs has said
459600	463120	is that Donald Trump's plan would make the economy worse.
463120	465120	Mine would strengthen the economy.
465120	468960	What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump's plan
468960	471920	would actually explode the deficit.
471920	476200	Sixteen Nobel laureates have described his economic plan
476200	478680	as something that would increase inflation
478680	482760	and by the middle of next year would invite a recession.
482760	485320	You just have to look at where we are
485320	486720	and where we stand on the issues.
486720	488400	And I'd invite you to know
488400	491680	that Donald Trump actually has no plan for you
491680	494560	because he is more interested in defending himself
494560	496720	than he is in looking out for you.
496720	497800	That's just a sound bite.
497800	499200	They gave her that to say.
499200	501520	Look, I went to the Wharton School of Finance
501520	504320	and many of those professors, the top professors,
504320	506120	think my plan is a brilliant plan.
506120	506960	It's a great plan.
506960	509680	It's a plan that's going to bring up our worth,
509680	510960	our value as a country.
510960	513800	It's going to make people want to be able to go and work
513800	518200	and create jobs and create a lot of good, solid money
518200	520000	for our country.
520000	523840	And just to finish off, she doesn't have a plan.
523840	528560	She copied Biden's plan and it's like four sentences,
528560	532400	like run, spot, run, four sentences that are just,
532400	534560	oh, we'll try and lower taxes.
534560	535480	She doesn't have a plan.
535480	538400	Take a look at her plan. She doesn't have a plan.
538400	539240	Mr. President.
