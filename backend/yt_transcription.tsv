21.92	26.160000000000004	looking forward to a spirited and
23.72	27.519	thoughtful debate so let's get started I
26.16	29.279	want to begin tonight with the issue
27.519	31.24	that voters repeatedly say is their
29.279	33.48	number one issue and that is the economy
31.24	35.04	and the cost of living in this country
33.48	36.718999999999994	vice president Harris you and president
35.04	38.8	Trump were elected four years ago and
36.719	41.160000000000004	your opponent on the stage here tonight
38.8	43.48	often asks his supporters are you better
41.16	45.16	off than you were four years ago when it
43.48	46.64	comes to the economy do you believe
45.16	50.76	Americans are better off that they were
46.64	53.399	four years ago so I was raised as a
50.76	55.879	middle class kid and I am actually the
53.399	57.64	only person on this stage who has a plan
55.879	60.16	that is about lifting up the middle
57.64	63.039	class and working people of America I
60.16	65.439	believe in the Ambitions the aspirations
63.039	67.72	the dreams of the American people and
65.439	69.55999999999999	that is why I imagine and have actually
67.72	71.72	a plan to build what I call an
69.56	74.64	opportunity economy because here's the
71.72	77.08	thing we know that we have a a shortage
74.64	78.88	of of homes and housing and the cost of
77.08	81.64	housing is too expensive for far too
78.88	84.6	many people we know that young families
81.64	87.759	need support to raise their children and
84.6	90.24	I intend on extending a tax cut for
87.759	92.56	those families of $6,000 which is is the
90.24	94.96	largest child tax credit that we have
92.56	97.56	given in a long time so that those young
94.96	100.67999999999999	families can afford to buy a crib buy a
97.56	103.52	car seat buy clothes for their children
100.68	105.60000000000001	my passion one of them is small
103.52	107.84	businesses I was actually my mother
105.6	109.6	raised my sister and me but there was a
107.84	111.119	woman who helped raise us we call her
109.6	113.0	our second mother she was a small
111.119	115.88	business owner I love our small
113.0	119.159	businesses my plan is to give a
115.88	121.399	$50,000 tax deduction to Startup small
119.159	123.84	businesses knowing they are part of the
121.399	126.119	backbone of America's economy my
123.84	129.20000000000002	opponent on the other hand his plan is
126.119	129.2	to do what he has done before
